  Once upon a time, there was a warrior destined for an adventure. The first step of his journey was to find a companion that would accompany him on his noble quest. He came across three people with magical powers, Cassandra, Caleb, and Gil, but he is now forced to choose one of them. Each one held their own powers. Cassandra was able to see in the future, while Caleb could go back in time, and Gilberto could re-arrage time itself. But the warrior obviously chose Caleb because his striking good looks and unbelievable power made the choice very easy. Cassandra and Gil became very salty towards the fact that they weren't chosen and began stalking the warrior and Caleb and planning their revenge.
